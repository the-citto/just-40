# Just 40

40% keyboard project, with just 40 keys.

## KLEs

[Keyboard-Layout-Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) configurations.

Both layouts use the same keys for the same columns, just different key sizes.

Traditional uses the standard spacebar remaining as close as possible to standard
60%, 80%, and 100%.
The [HHKB](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) style will perhaps be more ergonomic,
but moving further away from standards.
