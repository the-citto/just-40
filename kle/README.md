# Layers

#### Base
With the standard spacebar, remaining as close as possible to standard 60%, 80%, and 100%.

#### Navigation

The colour hints are about what I'd like to get from the [firmware](#firmware).

This mapping is based on what I'm using for my 60%, 
I'll have to get used to the `F` keys as there I have them mapped on `1` to `= +`

#### Punctuation

Also with colour hints, some of the keys are where they could be expected to be, 
different colours for the ones that needed to be completely moved.

More likely I'll use the keycaps with the punctuation to get used with it, and blanks for the keys not mapped here.

#### Hardware Controls

Never used media keys etc., but surely Bluetooth selectors and `NKRO`, 
likely some control for the OLED, like show battery level etc.... at that point I should also add media and some RGB keys.

### HHBK
With a 2.25 as spacebar it turns out as a nice [HHKB](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) style.
Perhaps it'll be more ergonomic, but moving further away from standards measures, which is what I want to achieve.
