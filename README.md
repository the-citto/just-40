# Just 40

A 40% keyboard project, with just 40 keys.

Started the project after just one year of having started using mechanical keyboards. 

Just a month or two after the first Keychron K8 Pro ISO, I swithced to a 
Keychron K1 Pro ANSI (low profile). The K8 was nice and the K1 much nicer.

Less then a month before starting theis repo I switched to the 60% K9 Pro - even better.

Changed the switches to Gateron banana, added o-rings
and by then I relized I was already too deep into the rabbit hole... concerning how little it took!

I've searched for qute some time for 40% offerings, the most interesting to me
 - [Vortex Core Plus](https://vortexgear.store/products/core-plus)
 - [Litl keyboard](https://sthlmkb.com/shop/litl-keyboard-kit/)
 - [Skelett 40](https://novelkeys.com/collections/keyboards/products/skelett-40-keyboard-kit)

All three are very nice but none has RGB (not sure about the Core),
the Core has too many keys (well, not really, but then why leave my nice 60%?),
and both Litl and Skelett have some key not where I wish they were...


#### Why 40%?

Ergonomics!

I want to move my hands even less than I do with the 60%

#### Why staggered vs ortholinear split?

I mulled for long about it, but I feel staggered bewing ergonomic just right.

My hands and wrists are correctly angled, the same as they would be on a split,
and in that position the staggered keys turn out to be int the right position -
honestly I can't understand why I never read this from anybody else.

Last, as a musician, I really don't mind moving my fingers even in weird 'contorsions',
so long as I can keep my elbows and wrists relaxed.

## Specs

Considered handwiring and I know I would have loved it, but wanting RGB it seemed prohivitive.

Low profile for the ergonomics. Really considered hard to use standard MX,
mostly for the stabilizers since I can't say I like the low profile's, but MXLPs will be.

RGB because I'm a kid at heart (but no animations). I've been wanting to try customizing QKM
to get per-key colours, particularly on layers.

While I'm there I'll use hot-swaps.

## KLEs

[Keyboard-Layout-Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) configurations.

Both layouts use the same keys for the same columns, just different key sizes.

#### Traditional
With the standard spacebar remaining as close as possible to standard
60%, 80%, and 100%.

#### HHBK
The [HHKB](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/) style will perhaps be more ergonomic,
but moving further away from standards.
