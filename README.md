# Just 40

A 40% keyboard project, just 40 keys.

![traditional keys](kle/traditional.png)

I do like the staggered layout, with wrists slightly angled the keys turn out just alligned.
Plus, the layout and key sizes are the same as the standards 60% (the one I'm using now), 80%, and 100%.

#### Alternatives / Inspirations
I've searched for quite some time for 40% offerings, the most interesting to me
 - [Vortex Core Plus](https://vortexgear.store/products/core-plus)
 - [Litl keyboard](https://sthlmkb.com/shop/litl-keyboard-kit/)
 - [Skelett 40](https://novelkeys.com/collections/keyboards/products/skelett-40-keyboard-kit)

All three are very nice but none has RGB (not sure about the Core),
the Core has too many keys (well, not really, but then why leave my nice 60%?),
and both Litl and Skelett have some key not where I wish they were...

## Hardware

I considered handwiring and I know I would have loved it, but wanting RGB
and as low a possible profile, it seemed prohivitive.

RGB because I'm a kid at heart (but no animations). I've been wanting to try customizing QKM
to get per-key colours, particularly on layers.

While I'm there I'll use [hot-swap sockets](#hot-swap-sockets).

### LEDs

### Switches

Low profile for the ergonomics. Really considered hard to use standard MX,
mostly for the stabilizers since I can't say I like the low profile's, but MXLPs will be.

Will be mounted south-facing ([somebody did it](https://www.xda-developers.com/what-i-want-in-my-dream-keyboard/#:~:text=South%2Dfacing%20customizable%20LEDs).)
